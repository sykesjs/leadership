Our team has an opening as a pod lead. I'd like to describe the opportunity a bit and lay out a few details. Based on input from the current pod leads, your name was recommended to interview for this opportunity.

1. All of the candidates for this new pod lead responsibility are current employees.
1. We think the fairest way to think about this opportunity would be to invite the folks who we thought would be a good fit for this opportunity to interview with us.
1. If you aren't interested at this time, this will not prevent you from future leadership opportunities.
You might have to switch projects you are working on in order to take this opportunity. (depending on what happens or who is selected).

Now for the really fun stuff:

1. This opportunity isn't directly tied to a promotion though it likely may lead to promotion opportunities.
1. This opportunity would include regular participation in meetings of department leads. In those meetings, we discuss the way the team is moving overall and discussions on leveling up the entire practice.
1. You will have direct supervisory responsibilities.
1. If you are selected, you will be evaluating the technical, teamwork and leadership contributions of the people in your pod.
1. You will be expected to lead your pod and complete (or delegate the competition) of the monthly report.
1. The interview questions are publicly available and you will complete them in written form before the interview. The in person interview will be an exploration of your written responses.
