We appreciate your time in our Pod Lead interview process. 
We are open to any feedback on the process, the interview itself or any communication we attempted. 
We are always looking to improve and you input is welcome.

 Items to consider:

* Where the questions balanced, and did they provide an opportunity for us to fully explore the opportunity and your skills?
* Was the communication prior, during and after the interview adequate?
* Was there enough time for the interview?
* Were there any technology or other issues we should be aware of in the future?
* Any other issues you noticed?

We hope this process not only helped select the best candidate for the position, but also gives you a plan to grow and improve your skills. 
Feel free to follow up with your Pod Leads to define goals and tasks to grow your strengths and follow up on opportunities.

Thanks again for your time and please keep the dialogue open!
